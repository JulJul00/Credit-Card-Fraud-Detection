# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Fraud Detection model based on anonymized credit card transactions
![image](picture)

Dataset: Transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
Duration: Two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
Class Imbalance: Fraudulent transactions (positive class) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
Features:
Numerical input variables resulting from PCA transformation.
'Time': Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction.
'Amount': Transaction amount, suitable for cost-sensitive learning.
Target:
'Class': Response variable, 1 for fraud, 0 otherwise.

Source:
The dataset has been collected and analyzed by Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (MLG) of Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) as part of a research collaboration on big data mining and fraud detection.
More details on the current and past projects related to fraud detection are available on the MLG website and ResearchGate.
Recommendations:
Due to class imbalance, accuracy should be measured using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful.
